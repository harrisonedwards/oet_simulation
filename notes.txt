#DONE
-which direction the robot is facing
-relative location of the closest wall
-relative location of the drop zone
-the number of green cells that have not been placed in the drop zone
-the type and relative location of the closest cell (maybe make it the 3 closest cells?)
-whether or not the robot is currently holding a cell, and what type it is

#TODO


ACTIONS

-move forward
-move backwards
-turn right
